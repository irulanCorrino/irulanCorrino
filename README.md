- 👋 Hi, I’m @irulanCorrino
- 👀 I’m interested in audio production & performance tools.
- 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning kTurtle scripting language and i am going to return to learning C/C++ in shortest terms. other my target languages/environments are Lua Nyquist and Supercollider.
- #by now [1st of june 2022] i am uncertain on a subject of future of some particular software i had chosen. i am a performer and a composer so my favorite applications were Audacity and Musescore among the others. but after i have learned that both projects are owned by russian commercial organisation Muse Group i have my attitude changed. and i live in Crimea so i have even more reasons for ending with an image of happily satisfied user of those two private applications. futhermore i have encountered numerous issues using them --while most are brought my 3d-blindness some are plainly ridiculous features or misfits in design that i would be happy to get rid of. namely ones are non-destructive editing in Audacity (introduced in v.3) and inherent oddities of note input in Musescore.
- #i have decided to get deeply into C/C++ and to fork both projects while departing from their respective development teams in an entire. i am going to maintain both projects using only my own coding power!!!
- #there is an issue i have encountered while studying Nyquist: i am not sure it is good for me... there are pros for keeping it in Audacity (it is a thing and it is working) but there are cons i cannot take: a. it has non-transparent syntax [i am not a fan of LISP but i accept Scheme however]; b. it is undermaintained if not an abandonware as i have found while encountering a reference to MS Windows 95/98 in its manual that mentioned some troubles with IDE's shell; c. '[...]and viola!, we have Nyquist control constructs in SAL even though SAL is completely unaware that seqrep is actually a special form.' ...and i am not sure if i would be able to use something else in a place of it even if trying making a Scheme module.
- #i have chosen EFL/Enlightenment for a toolkit and i am going to switch to Wayland in time with EFL.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on development of Pipewire sound server.
- 📫 How to reach me ?.. :D oh it is REALLY difficult --i dedicate most of my time to learning and performing music so i have virtually no time to socialising...
