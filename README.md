- 👋 Hi, I’m @irulanCorrino

<img align="right" width="60%" alt="" title="you miss ONLY eusexua" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e6770096-6116-44b4-b424-8f5355d5a23b">

- and i'm done with Wikipedia
- 👀 I’m interested in audio production & performance tools, yet in interface design and in the progress of UI paradigms
- i am with 3D-blindness so i rely on my enhanced color sense and yet for spatial orientation and identifying objects or events i heavily use my hearing
- i am an [anarchist](https://github.com/irulanCorrino/eggnog-dominance/blob/main/diary-of-siren/08-diary-of-a-siren.md) and i feel for Yeshua, the Messiah, blessed by Her-Maker; while being born into human species i represent different from humans species called [Ynnwn or "Rhythm"](https://github.com/irulanCorrino/thoaishis)
- if you are wondering what causes your suffering from insensetivity of society around you --`proletarians are parasits`
  - no more commerce; no more exploitation; no patriarchy --no school teachers, no teachers as a speciality --it is a patriarchal abuse
  - patriarchy promoters ("teachers") never care that some person may need `the most detailed explanation is possible` and patriarchal consumerism does not care if an artisan needs decades to learn the craft thoroughly
  - educators of dangerous crafts must account that some persons are incapable to feel the pain so are more vulnerable to doing an unintentional self-harm
  - eventually, as a result of expansionism, consumerist lifestyle will collapse --people hunting new posessions will be ridiculously futile in their own eyes when `the best trait declared is a creativity`, and there are literally thousands of worlds already and their number is ever increasing

- when i was between 11 and 14, not sure when exactly, the genetic test revealed i am not a boy, probably it was a nation‑wide screening in post‑Soviet Ukraine; the results were announced before whole our class, they also announced i am infertile [maybe they had sampled the semen first, i do not remember]
- they were like "you were told there are 14 boys and 15 girls in your class; it isn’t so, there is one more girl in your class, so the class consists of 13 boys and 16 girls —[my_name] is a girl."
- 💞️ i had married a boy after that genetic screening, i felt for Timmo since we both were 7, our marriage lasted but not for long —we were forbidden from meeting one another after the school because my patriarchal step-parents had tried to comply with local people who had gotten severe communist frustration finding we are married
- i started learning to code before 13, i guess, i looked at machine code dump of `Lode Runner` for an extinct soviet-designed PC in a tech magazine for teenagers around 1993; before that i had a great delight from interpreting karik images of robots/computers in a rubbish soviet tech/science digest. i studied BASIC between 14 and 17, then i had enrolled to an institute where i was forced to study Borland Pascal 5.0 but even though i was the best programmer in the institute i had dropped out before my 19th birthday because: a) i disliked the institute, b) i had found early linux on CD i had won in a quiz from 'Chip-Ukraine' magazine [i had no computer to try the linux image but i was inspired by FSF, GNU and my hero Linus], c) i have a discalculia but no academia has any compassion to a poor pretty intersex girl [so i was overloaded badly to keep up with the first year subjects, i mean, math]. there was very little of programming on real machines, just rhombuses and arrows
- 🌱 I had returned to programming by learning kTurtle scripting language at the age of 34 and i am going to begin coding using C in shortest terms /* i tried to study it before kTurtle */. other languages i want to know are Nyquist, XLisp, Scheme, csound, pureData, Ruby; i DO LOVE Assembly and i learned IBM S/360 Assembly many years ago, now i am going to continue, but with x86_64 arch, and it is a big hope for me.

- 📫 How to reach me ?.. :D oh it is REALLY difficult --i dedicate most of my time to learning and performing music so i have virtually no time to socialising.. but you may email me on any issue, i check my mail about thrice a month
