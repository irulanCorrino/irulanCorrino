- üëã Hi, I‚Äôm @irulanCorrino
- üëÄ I‚Äôm interested in audio production & performance tools.
- i am with 3D-blindness so i mostly use my hearing for spatial orientation
and identifying objects or events.

- i am unable to remember or even to recognise faces ...even faces of ones i vowed of kemmer with.
- i am a soprano singer had undergone a mutation to the contralto voice [in one very very sad day].
- i am able to imitate any [female, naturally] voice both for spoken and sung positions.
- i have a perfect pitch. my biological species is called 'rhythm'. we originate from a world of Gethen ['Winter'].

- üå± I‚Äôm currently learning kTurtle scripting language and i am going to return to learning C/C++ in shortest terms. other my target languages/environments are Lua Nyquist and Supercollider.
- #by now [1st of june 2022] i am uncertain on a subject of future of some particular software i had chosen. i am a performer and a composer so my favorite applications were Audacity and Musescore among the others. but after i have learned that both projects are owned by russian commercial organisation Muse Group i have my attitude changed. and i live in Crimea so i have even more reasons for ending with an image of happily satisfied user of those two private applications. futhermore i have encountered numerous issues using them --while most are brought my 3d-blindness some are plainly ridiculous features or misfits in design that i would be happy to get rid of. namely ones are non-destructive editing in Audacity (introduced in v.3) and inherent oddities of note input in Musescore.
- #i have decided to get deeply into C/C++ and to fork both projects while departing from their respective development teams in an entire. i am going to maintain both projects using only my own coding power!!!
- #there is an issue i have encountered while studying Nyquist: i am not sure it is good for me... there are pros for keeping it in Audacity (it is a thing and it is working) but there are cons i cannot take: a. it has non-transparent syntax [i am not a fan of LISP but i accept Scheme however]; b. it is undermaintained if not an abandonware as i have found while encountering a reference to MS Windows 95/98 in its manual that mentioned some troubles with IDE's shell; c. '[...]and viola!, we have Nyquist control constructs in SAL even though SAL is completely unaware that seqrep is actually a special form.' ...and i am not sure if i would be able to use something else in a place of it even if trying making a Scheme module.
- #i have chosen EFL/Enlightenment for a toolkit and i am going to switch to Wayland in time with EFL.
- @i have tried Enlightenment[^1] after installing arch linux on my older laptop --i am very disappointed by a fact that this window manager had had no improvements IN NINE YEARS! i used ubuntu-based bodhi linux back then and it had so many issues that i had switched to official ubuntu flavour; now i have decided to deprecate ALL GUI/widget TOOLKITS and to learn c/c++ programming deeper for making all the interface stuff by myself. [i use xfce4 as my desktop environment now --it never disappointed me during years i used it in ubuntuStudio me even if being not friendly to a user with 3D-blindness like me]
- üíûÔ∏è I‚Äôm looking to collaborate on development of Pipewire sound server [is not valid assertion anylonger --see below]
- #...and now [2nd of june 2022] i consider stopping using my computers for my musical practice in an entire --i have installed pipewire and have managed to make it working despite all of tribulations posed by systemd ...and seeing 'rtkit module error' i have stopped the service! so it does not start anymore. it just tells about start attempts count limit again and again.

- @i am required to keep pipewire installed even if not being fascinated with it anymore --to keep it just as a vestigial organ of systemd and pulseaudio. if needed i would learn alsa internals [@kernel.org] and would convert all my stuff to pure alsa interfacing [i bet i need it because while i used ubuntustudio (lowlatency not realtime) audacity was not able to make a recording longer than two or even one minutes without jack server running --i refuse to use jackd as well]

- @i to tried to register at arch linux forums for getting a help but they do not offer help --they only give ADVICES. and that does violate my shifgrethor. i shall play music without you
---
- üì´ How to reach me ?.. :D oh it is REALLY difficult --i dedicate most of my time to learning and performing music so i have virtually no time to socialising...
