- 👋 Hi, I’m @irulanCorrino
- 👀 I’m interested in audio production & performance tools.
- i am with 3D-blindness so i mostly use my hearing for spatial orientation
and identifying objects or events.

- i am unable to remember or even to recognise faces ...even faces of ones i vowed of kemmer with.
- i am a soprano singer had undergone a mutation to the contralto voice [in one very very sad day].
- i am able to imitate any [female, naturally] voice both for spoken and sung positions.
- i have a perfect pitch. my biological species is called 'rhythm'. we originate from a world of Gethen ['Winter'].

> i have learned to read & write in six years. i was in first grade of primary school then.
> the biggest problem in learning writing for me was in differentiating between shapes of [russian] letters.
> i have encountered the same exact problem during learning to read already but this time
> it was unsurmountable task. my biggest difficulty was in that i could not memorize spatial
> orientation and a chirality of strokes! i have learned to read WITHOUT memorizing those two properties.
> but in learning to write there was a person THAT CONTROLLED the character of my cognition!!!
> she [the teacher] switched the pen from my left hand into the right one repeatedly and then
> later was watching over me to keep me not rotating or mirroring the letters.
>
> the woman that adopted me ['mother'] kept a letter written to her by me from a rural ukrainian town
> during summer rest months in august`s end. she was convinced that i made severe spelling mistakes
> because of an illiteracy --i skipped letters in some words and substituted letters for similar ones...
> but i always remember the days i was composing my [first] letter. it was happening either between
> first and second school grades [in the age of seven; is the most probable case] or second and third grades.
> i INTENTIONALLY skipped letters that i could not substitute with similarly written ones!!! [my teacher saw it too]
> the crying example: '"apricotes" [are] ripening' (russian does not use the verb here) --it should be spelled
> 'abrikosy pospeva<yu>t' but i have realized this like 'oriks pospivut'.
>
> the EXPLANATION:
> russian script for 'a' & 'b' & 'y' ([ɯ], close back unrounded vowel) & 'e' (in this case
> is identical to latin script) & '<yu>' (like in russian realisation of [ˈkʲʉrʲɪj] 'curium', near-close
> central protruded vowel) IS EXTREMELY COMPLEX to read to me [even now] but in writing it is
> something UNMEMORIZABLE and totally INVISIBLE
>      [because (a) i do not see both horizontal (and no one can
> know THE DISTANCE to them [sic]) and vertical STRAIGHT strokes (after my 3D-blindness)]
> and particularly russian book fonts abuse straight edges(!!! 'bad furniture!') and strokes;
>       and (b) because i rotate and mirror EVERYTHING I SEE since i remember myself as an organic being (that is
> since my cells have begun the division not since a start of generation of my neural system);
>       that yields (c) no reading ability to russian book fonts;
>       and (d) no writing ability to russian handwriting because of its manner of attaching various
> 'serifs' (curves) to similalarly identical 'o'-base for BOTH consonants and vowels!!!].
>
> SO how had 'abrikosy pospeva<yu>t' turned into 'oriks pospivut'?
> russians teach to write 'a' as 'o' with a serif on the right BUT i cannot remember both ist right or left
>             AND is its hook realised on the top stroke or bottom stroke part;
>         so it is substituted with 'o' intentionally;
> russian handwritten 'b' is looking like 'o' with [latin] 's'-curve attached to its top
>             => i cannot memorize a place of the attachment [left or right?] and a chirality of the curve BOTH
>             => i cannot SUBSTITUTE it with 'o' despite RUSSIANS DO TEACH to make in a manner they abuse
>                for teaching making 'a' --IT IS A CONSONANT!!!
>         so it is dropped;
> russian 'y' is just too complex for a child [if you did see it you know; i cannot write it still]
>         it is dropped as well;
> 'e' is a special matter: i can SEE it with a comfort BUT i mirror and/or rotate it WITH A COMFORT!
>             AND the teacher HAS FORBIDDEN me doing THAT strictly!
>         i substituted 'i' for 'e' (it is ukrainian realisation this word!) AND russian 'i' is realised
>         exactly like latin 'u' --i do not rotate it [only mirror, but in english ...'u' & 'n' ...you see];
> and finally '<yu>' is something terrible in cyrillic scripts --i can tell you nothing about it
>             --just take a look and you will know: 'кюрий'!!! can you imagine my REACTION on such object?
>         i sustitute 'u' for '<yu>' [yes yes maybe still do] --it is nicely aligning with the pronunciation
>         AND it is realised like latin 'y' that is not a problem for me:D :Q :E :P :K --i rotate it and
>         i mirror it FREELY but it is looking SO FRIENDLY in a handwriting!!!
>
> you may ask 'why is it not "abrikosy" but "oriks"?' 'where is "o"?'
> well ...it is A MISTAKE! do not do 'THINK TWICE'!!! ['boundaries double checking --clever but broken!']
> after substituting 'o' for 'a' AND dropping 'b' for resembling 'o'-if-not-posessing-the-serif
> i SIMPLY FAIL to write 'o' ONCE AGAIN!!! [INTENTIONALLY --'kernel panics do you know?']
>
> in six grade of middle school (our class had skipped initial fifth grade) that trouble was STILL SIGNIFICANT

- oh... just have realised that. there was `'a'` in that russian `'pospeva<yu>t'`. so what to do now?
- `"but i wrote it down in my notes, don juan."`
- `"you may write whatever you want, but don't tell me i said that."`
- 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning kTurtle scripting language and i am going to return to learning C /* [and] C++ —is not valuable anymore, see below */ in shortest terms. other my target languages/environments are Lua, Nyquist [i am considering porting it to Scheme] [1st of March, 2023] /* [and] Supercollider —i was interested in it since i did not consider its implementation language, C++, as being of inferior quality, but now i am not fascinated with either of them anymore] */. i do like Rust and i would like to learn it, but i am currently studying C and i cannot switch between them, additionally Rust has less transparent semantics having much higher level of abstraction —i could not get into C++ because of its raffinated phony, but+ i cannot grasp Rust’s concepts because they are too complex too me. i DO LOVE Assembly and i learned IBM S/360 Assembly many years ago, now i am going to continue, but with x86_64 arch, it is a big hope for me.
- #by now [1st of june 2022] i am uncertain on a subject of future of some particular software i had chosen. i am a performer and a composer so my favorite applications were Audacity and Musescore among the others. but after i have learned that both projects are owned by russian commercial organisation Muse Group i have my attitude changed. and i live in Crimea so i have even more reasons for ending with an image of happily satisfied user of those two private applications. futhermore i have encountered numerous issues using them --while most are brought my 3d-blindness some are plainly ridiculous features or misfits in design that i would be happy to get rid of. namely ones are non-destructive editing in Audacity (introduced in v.3) and inherent oddities of note input in Musescore.
- #i have decided to get deeply into C/C++ and to fork both projects while departing from their respective development teams in an entire. i am going to maintain both projects using only my own coding power!!!
- #there is an issue i have encountered while studying Nyquist: i am not sure it is good for me... there are pros for keeping it in Audacity (it is a thing and it is working) but there are cons i cannot take: a. it has non-transparent syntax [i am not a fan of LISP but i accept Scheme however]; b. it is undermaintained if not an abandonware as i have found while encountering a reference to MS Windows 95/98 in its manual that mentioned some troubles with IDE's shell; c. '[...]and viola!, we have Nyquist control constructs in SAL even though SAL is completely unaware that seqrep is actually a special form.' ...and i am not sure if i would be able to use something else in a place of it even if trying making a Scheme module.
- #i have chosen EFL/Enlightenment for a toolkit and i am going to switch to Wayland in time with EFL.
- @i have tried Enlightenment[^1] after installing arch linux on my older laptop --i am very disappointed by a fact that this window manager had had no improvements IN NINE YEARS! i used ubuntu-based bodhi linux back then and it had so many issues that i had switched to official ubuntu flavour; now i have decided to deprecate ALL GUI/widget TOOLKITS and to learn c/c++ programming deeper for making all the interface stuff by myself. [i use xfce4 as my desktop environment now --it never disappointed me during years i used it in ubuntuStudio me even if being not friendly to a user with 3D-blindness like me]

- ##[11th of july 2022] for many years i was convinced that i should
`watch TV` --that is `learn C++`. i was led to believe that a sufficiently
well knowledge of it would be a sign of having good coding skills.
even encountering broken code at wikipedia tutorials i supposed that
was an issue of a primer not of the language itself.
i cannot recollect where exactly i had met the instruction to use C++
for making user interfaces if coding an application in C: it might be
read in one of learning books from QNX i studied in year-tenth-ago or
most probably i had picked it from some wikipedia article that was
rewritten multiple times during these years.
now i understand that even if they declare their software as being free
most of so-called IT professionals are interested only in getting money
from selling their software. they cannot be perfect coders then.
but they DO code in C++!
i have found `www.suckless.org` tonight and while they are seemingly allies
for a natty coder like me they are not! having a front page describing
their apparently impeccable philosophy they as well have a list of 'sucks'
[that i do not want to discuss here] and a list of 'rocks' and it is
where it becomes obvious they are telling things they do not know about.
they worship some quiet obscure OS called Plan 9 but its development
had stopped in year-seventh-ago and it is not a major issue for me still.
firstly: they recommend MUSL that had critical flaw in memory allocation
for years [source: wikipedia]; and then at the end of list is xzoom that i used
to have while using Socialism Studio 20.04. it is REALLY BAD piece of
an abandonware.
- @@that was said by a different person that has changed my mindset.
i believe to linus not wikipedia or QNX Corp. or suckless guys.
C++ is really bad. and i would develop my GUI in C.

- @@i do not comprehend `classes` even if encountered them ten years ago.
i understand C's `structs` well... but classes were something non-transparent
for me in wikipedia primers. i guess would not need any of C++ features.
i just want clean neo-baroque code and full integration of GUI with the logic.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on development of Pipewire sound server [is not valid assertion anylonger --see below]
- #...and now [2nd of june 2022] i consider stopping using my computers for my musical practice in an entire --i have installed pipewire and have managed to make it working despite all of tribulations posed by systemd ...and seeing 'rtkit module error' i have stopped the service! so it does not start anymore. it just tells about start attempts count limit again and again.

- @i am required to keep pipewire installed even if not being fascinated with it anymore --to keep it just as a vestigial organ of systemd and pulseaudio. if needed i would learn alsa internals [@kernel.org] and would convert all my stuff to pure alsa interfacing [i bet i need it because while i used ubuntustudio (lowlatency not realtime) audacity was not able to make a recording longer than two or even one minutes without jack server running --i refuse to use jackd as well /* see below for an update */]

- @i to tried to register at arch linux forums for getting a help but they do not offer help --they only give ADVICES. and that does violate my shifgrethor. i shall play music without you
#### updated in december 2022
+ i am using Artix linux
+ i am using OpenRC
+ i am trying to get XFCE working [have some crashing] while using Plasma in another laptop
+ i am happy with jack2 and going to study ALSA as promised
+ i am making a repository containing audacity-2-4-2 [and porting it to GPL-v3.0]
+ i am reading K&R 'The C Programming Language'
+ i am developing my fork of audacity targeting a guitarist/performer
#### updated at 1st of March, 2023
+ my first computer is seemingly OK with XFCE by now, but we need more time to make sure
+ the repository containing audacity-2-4-2 is completed, but i want a little more
+ i design new type of GUI —'Slacker' —a kinda hybrid of WIMP and zooming interface, targeting 3d‑blind or anandamide‑high users [belonging to my species]
+ i am making exercises from K&R book
+ i had had a fifth metacarpal fracture @20220913 and it has ruined my guitar techniques. i am taking large doses [2*2*120000SPU] of serrapeptase for some two months, but i have bad tendon tethering still
---
- 📫 How to reach me ?.. :D oh it is REALLY difficult --i dedicate most of my time to learning and performing music so i have virtually no time to socialising...
